To make it easier for users to find historical websites from public entities, we have made a register of websites from public entities.

Information is extraced from historical versions of the Norwegian Enhetsregisteret, and contain the names of ca 1500 public entities and their registered 'homepage'. It should be noted that the register is deficient, as many public actors lack information about web address.
