To make it easier for users to find historical newspapers, we have made a register of Norwegian newspapers published on the web between 2005-21, and their historical addresses.

The register is made by combining different overviews of Norwegian newspapers in the period. It may refer to publications that at the moment can't be found through URL search, due to uncompleted indexing.
